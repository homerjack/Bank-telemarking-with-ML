# Machine Learning Classification project


### Summary

This is a project on the use of Machine Learning Classification models to predict the success of a bank telemarketing call, namely:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Linear Support Vector

To tackle the issue of an imbalanced dataset, 2 techniques (SMOTE and class weights) were explored.

Please refer to the PDF document in the repository for the full write-up on this project, which is to be read in-conjunction with the i-python notebook. Please use the html export if the ipynb is not rendering on Github.
